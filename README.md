## Architecture
We implemented the Model View ViewModel Architecture in our project, it worked best for us and gave us the best structure for this Project. Our Fragments and UserInterface based classes are in the view, the connection between the room database and the view is the ViewModel and in the Database we have all methods related to the database like the tododao or repository which is also a part of the model as well as a converter and the todoitem imlementation.
